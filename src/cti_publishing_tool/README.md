# cti-publishing-tool

## Purpose
The purpose of this directory is to convert JSON exports from the CTI Authoring Tool into common formats for distribution or storage. Currently available formats are: Microsoft Word DOCX and PDF. Additionally, a HTML file is generated if users wish to convert reports independently.

## Project setup
Run all commands in the publishing folder.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dependencies
This library will not work without the following libraries:
liquid, htmldocx, docx2pdf

## Functionality, features
* Incremental guided command line interface for users unfamiliar with Python scripts.
* Command line arguments skip the interface for users experienced with Python scripts.
* Users are able to select specified categories for publication, or exclude specified categories from publication.
* Files can be dragged and dropped onto the terminal to quickly input the datafile's location on disk.
* Unrecognized arguments will be skipped, making it so that unneccessary sections will not be appended.
