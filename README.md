# CTI Blueprints

CTI Blueprints is a free suite of templates and tools that helps Cyber Threat
Intelligence (CTI) analysts create high-quality, actionable reports more consistently
and efficiently. CTI analysts face many challenges and constraints, including time and
resource constraints, lack of analytic training and guidance, and lack of feedback from
CTI consumers on what works. This project seeks to increase the operational relevance of
reports through a standardized set of templates that help analysts answer specific
analytic questions for common cyber security use cases. This project is created and
maintained by the MITRE Engenuity Center for Threat-Informed Defense in futherance of
our mission to advance the start of the art and the state of the practice in
threat-informed defense globally. The project is funded by our [research participants](https://mitre-engenuity.org/blog/2023/06/12/cti-blueprints/#research-participants).

## Getting Started

To get started, we suggest reading the One Pager for an overview of the project and
then read the sample reports. For a deeper dive, read the wiki documentation and review
the CTI templates. From there, try creating your own reports using either the Word
templates or the Blueprints Suite of tools.

## Getting Involved

There are several ways that you can get involved with this project and help advance
threat-informed defense:

- **Review the [One Pager](https://github.com/center-for-threat-informed-defense/cti-blueprints/blob/main/CTI_Blueprints_One_Pager.pdf) and [sample reports](./samples).** This will give you
  a quick overview of the project's goals and help to envision your own capability to
  use it.
- **Read [the
  documentation](https://github.com/center-for-threat-informed-defense/cti-blueprints/wiki).**
  The project wiki goes deeper into the project's goals and objectives.
- **Create your own reports.** Choose one of two approaches for creating reports:
  - Build reports with the [Word templates](./templates), which are user friendly and
    are the fastest way to get up and running with CTI Blueprints.
  - Build reports with the CTI Blueprints Suite, which is a set of tools for authoring
    and publishing CTI reports that is highly flexible and has time-saving features.
    This approach requires more initial investment in setup and learning.
